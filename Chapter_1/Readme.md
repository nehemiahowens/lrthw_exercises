In the Readme.md for this directory, explain how you got rid of the offenses.  Did you fix the strings?
* I found an exception for the guardfile which allowed for the string to be used as specified in the lrthw exercise. (see .yml file)

Or did you tell Rubocop to ignore those code style violations? 

Why did you pick what you did?


Please include the Study Drills stuff in your ex1.rb file.
