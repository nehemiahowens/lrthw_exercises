    There are 10 types of people.
    Those who know binary and those who don't.
    I said: There are 10 types of people..
    I also said: 'Those who know binary and those who don't.'.
    Isn't that joke so funny?! false
    This is the left side of ...a string with a ride side.
    
### Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
See ex6.rb

### Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
```puts "I also said: '#{y}'."```

### Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
I know there is only one place because at the beginning of the lesson Zed says, "A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone, or "export" out of the program you are writing. Ruby knows you want something to be a string when you put either " (double-quotes) or ' (single-quotes) around the text."


### Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
We assigned the output of the vaiables to add themselves to eachother by using the + symbol

### What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single-quote) instead of " (double-quote)? Do they still work? Try to guess why
I believe they will not work when using the single quotes because the string will not know where to being and end.
