# Study Drills:

## 1) Add comments to ex7.rb
see ex7.rb

## 2.) Please explain the difference between puts and print in your own words in the Readme.md.
It appears that the difference between the two is the line formatting; e.g. puts creates a new line and print can have multiple lines in succession.
